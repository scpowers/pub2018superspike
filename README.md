# AME 490: Directed Research

This repository contains the code for my directed research project titled "Learning Evolution Operators of Partial Differential Equations with Spiking Neural Networks". It modifies the example code accompanying the following paper:

Zenke, F., and Ganguli, S. (2018). SuperSpike: Supervised Learning in Multilayer Spiking Neural Networks. Neural Computation 30, 1514â€“1541.
